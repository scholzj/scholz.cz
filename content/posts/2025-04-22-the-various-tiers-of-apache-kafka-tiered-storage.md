title: "The various tiers of Apache Kafka Tiered Storage"
date: 2025-04-22
description: "When people think of tiered storage, they generally associate it with object storage such as Amazon S3. If you are in one of the public clouds, using their object storage is usually the most obvious choice. But what if you are running Kafka on-premises? There are multiple projects that allow you to deploy your own S3-compatible object storage. However, managing these deployments can be time-consuming. Will you be able to run it with the same durability and availability as AWS? And will it have comparable performance? That’s why it’s worth considering other storage options. In this post, we will look at how shared storage can be used as tiered storage."
