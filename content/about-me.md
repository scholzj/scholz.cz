I'm a CNCF Ambassador and a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat.
I have a long-term experience with Kubernetes, streaming, and messaging.
Currently, I focuses mainly on Apache Kafka and its integration with Kubernetes.
I'm one of the co-founders and lead maintainers of the [Strimzi project](https://strimzi.io), which provides tooling for running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes.
Before joining Red Hat, I worked as a messaging and solution architect in the financial industry.
