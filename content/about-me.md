I'm a CNCF Ambassador, software developer, and open source enthusiast.
I have long-term experience with Kubernetes, streaming, and messaging.
Currently, I focus mainly on Apache Kafka and its integration with Kubernetes.
I'm one of the co-founders and a lead maintainer of the [Strimzi project](https://strimzi.io), which provides tooling for running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes.
